  abstract={Heart rate complexity (HRC) is a proven metric for gaining insight into human stress and physiological deterioration. To calculate HRC, the detection of the exact instance of when the heart beats, the R-peak, is necessary. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals can often be corrupted by environmental noise (e.g., from electromagnetic interference, movement artifacts), which can potentially alter the HRC measurement, producing erroneous inputs which feed into decision support models. Current literature has only investigated how HRC is affected by noise when R-peak detection errors occur (false positives and false negatives). However, the numerical methods used to calculate HRC are also sensitive to the specific location of the fiducial point of the R-peak. This raises many questions regarding how this fiducial point is altered by noise, the resulting impact on the measured HRC, and how we can account for noisy HRC measures as inputs into our decision models. This work uses Monte Carlo simulations to systematically add white and pink noise at different permutations of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), time segments, sampling rates, and HRC measurements to characterize the influence of noise on the HRC measure by altering the fiducial point of the R-peak. Using the generated information from these simulations provides improved decision processes for system design which address key concerns such as permutation entropy being a more precise, reliable, less biased, and more sensitive measurement for HRC than sample and approximate entropy.}

  abstract={Significant health disparities exist between Hispanics and the general US population, complicated in part by communication, literacy, and linguistic factors. There are few available Spanish-language interactive, technology-driven health education programs that engage patients who have a range of health literacy levels. We describe the development of an interactive virtual patient educator for educating and counseling Hispanic women about cervical cancer and human papillomavirus. Specifically, we describe the iterative design methodology and rationale, usability evaluation, and pilot testing of the system with Hispanic women in a rural community in Florida. The pilot study findings provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility of the proposed patient education approach. The proposed application and the lessons learned will prove beneficial for future work targeted towards different cultural populations.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been an exponential growth in the number of complex documents and texts that require a deeper understanding of machine learning methods to be able to accurately classify texts in many applications. Many machine learning approaches have achieved surpassing results in natural language processing. The success of these learning algorithms relies on their capacity to understand complex models and non-linear relationships within data. However, finding suitable structures, architectures, and techniques for text classification is a challenge for researchers. In this paper, a brief overview of text classification algorithms is discussed. This overview covers different text feature extractions, dimensionality reduction methods, existing algorithms and techniques, and evaluations methods. Finally, the limitations of each technique and their application in real-world problems are discussed.}

  abstract={As social media platforms have grown to form the foundation of modern digital communication, digital text message datasets that document interpersonal exchanges on these platforms have proliferated. These exchanges comprise a rich corpus of social context data, which can provide insight into how mental health challenges manifest in social contexts. To date, researchers have employed a variety of methods for extracting mental health-centric features from digital text communication data, including natural language processing, social network analysis, sentiment analysis, time series analysis, and discourse analysis. However, there is a marked divide in current literature between qualitative and quantitative feature extraction methods. To effectively identify and analyze key underlying social contexts and related mental health factors from digital text communication data, researchers must extract a comprehensive corpus of features from raw textual data streams. In this paper, we present a generalized framework for extracting features from digital text communication datasets that leverages methodological approaches from diverse fields. This framework will serve to bridge the gap between quantitative and qualitative research approaches to analyzing digital text communications with respect to mental health.},
