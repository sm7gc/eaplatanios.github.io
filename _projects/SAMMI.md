  NMT systems typically consist of two main components: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder takes as input the source language sentence and generates some latent representation for it (e.g., a fixed-size vector). The decoder then takes that latent representation as input and generates a sentence in the target language. The sentence generation is often done in an autoregressive manner (i.e., words are generated one-by-one in a left-to-right manner).
